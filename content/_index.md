The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) aims to enhance access to Holocaust-related historical sources and promote transnational scholarship. The EHRI Portal hosts over 370,000 archival descriptions from 2,000 institutions worldwide. The EHRI-KG project will develop a comprehensive Linked Open Data (LOD) Knowledge Graph (KG) to complement the EHRI Portal and further advance data accessibility, aligning with the evolving semantic web and LOD Standards, and supporting the integration of Holocaust data into the EOSC.
